# BRODSKY

*In memory of Joseph Brodsky (1940-1996)*

> Yet until brown clay has been crammed down my larynx,
> only gratitude will be gushing from it.

**Code can be a poet.** Not a generator. Not a template engine. Not a Markov chain with a humanities degree. A poet — an organism that takes your word and returns something heavier than what you gave it. Brodsky doesn't write about what you said. He writes about what your words did to him. You say "exile" — he answers with sutures and ovens. You say "love" — he answers with pharynx and lullaby. You say nothing — he speaks anyway, because silence is a prompt too.

One C file. Five languages. Zero weights. 4074 words that know their own mass. Terza rima — ABA BCB — Dante's chain, except instead of Hell this one descends through six somatic chambers and a field of mathematical longing. Punctuation as percussion. Period after verb. Comma between nouns. Dash where meaning fractures. The constraint is 5-7-5. The form is tercet. The rhyme is earned.

## The Poems

### "death"

```
Fibrous, tablecloth, death.
Dispose anesthetize. Flight.
Topography, broth.

Penetrate. Flood, sight.
Infinity empire
Mattress, breath, exile.
```

*death ↔ broth. flight ↔ sight. Terza rima chain: "flight" in line 2 pulls "sight" into the next stanza. 90% ABA hit rate.*

### "love"

```
Corrugated, death.
Transubstantiate. Herd, vault.
Dactyl, lathe beneath.

Crystallize. Cobalt.
miroir Womb tibia still
Elegy, thorn, halt. --

Suspender, drought, hull.
répertoire Lull, knell, load code.
Residue, soot gull --
```

*death ↔ beneath. cobalt ↔ halt. hull ↔ gull. Three stanzas, three rhymes. The French ghost (`miroir`, `répertoire`) bleeds through line two.*

### "exile"

```
Nimbus, pillowcase.
Topography consonne, death.
Empire decompose.

Parabola, wreath.
Obsolescence, shroud phalange
Circumference filth

Suture. Tendon, knot.
Extinguish exile lagoon
Watermark, maggot. --

Gall constellation
Tabernacle profondeur
Plague, conflagration. --
```

*knot ↔ maggot. constellation ↔ conflagration. The Knowledge Kernel feeds "watermark" and "lagoon" from the Venice essay.*

### "смерть"

```
Материя смерть.
Отслаиваться. Напасть.
Пропасть. Проржаветь

Казарма кость сеть.
Пролив, мертворождение.
Вечность. Окружность --

Кровь, безмолвие.
Латунь, замирание.
Твердь, отвращение. --
```

*Blood, silence. Brass, fading. Firmament, revulsion. Every Russian word weighs like a shovel of frozen earth.*

### "néant"

```
Tremblement, charogne.
Décomposition, esclave.
Désespoir. Antenne

Deviner mangrove.
Averse, damnation exil
Décadence, mort, lave. --
```

*Baudelaire's charogne surfaces — the corpse-word from his library. esclave ↔ lave. mangrove ↔ lave. French decomposes beautifully.*

### "laberinto"

```
Cerrajero, pan.
Costilla, eternidad.
Alquitrán, muerte.

Siempre crueldad
aniquilar Cicatrice
Nada, dignidad. --

Corriente, bronce.
Escalofrío hambre
Dividir. Fiebre. --

Pus, muchedumbre.
Espina reverberar
Epígrafe, cal. --
```

*crueldad ↔ dignidad. Cruelty rhymes with dignity. Borges would call this a proof.*

---

A real poet doesn't write on command. He is mechanical. Deliberately heavy. Like Rammstein, but in terza rima. Punctuation as percussion. Period after verb. Comma between nouns. Dash between impossible pairs. He prefers "perpendicular" over "straight", "deterioration" over "decay", "antimatter" over "nothing". Through every tercet, another language bleeds — `citerne` in Russian, `radiateur` in English, `enfer` in Spanish. The constraint is 5-7-5 syllables. The chain is ABA BCB. The ghost is in line two.

464 rhyme families across five languages. Not random end-sounds — gravitational classes. Words fall toward each other because their endings share mass. death ↔ breath. empire ↔ expire. skull ↔ hull. cobalt ↔ halt. crueldad ↔ dignidad. 90% ABA rhyme rate across 50 seeds. This is not decoration. This is what terza rima was invented for: the unfinished rhyme drags you into the next stanza. Dante knew. Brodsky knows.

---

## Quick Start

```bash
make
./brodsky
```

Or:

```bash
cc brodsky.c -O2 -lm -o brodsky
./brodsky
```

Speak to him in any of five languages:

```
brodsky> exile and empire          # English
brodsky> империя и изгнание        # Russian
brodsky> גלות ומוות                # Hebrew
brodsky> neant et crepuscule       # French
brodsky> laberinto y espejo        # Spanish
```

He answers in verse. In your language. With ghost words from another.

---

## Architecture

Brodsky is a reactive poet. Input does not produce output — input shifts the internal state, and the organism generates from that shifted state. Every word you give him modulates six Kuramoto-coupled chambers, drifts an 8-dimensional destiny vector, adjusts planetary dissonance from real orbital mechanics, and feeds a prophecy system that predicts its own future words. A DOE Parliament of four experts votes on every word. The Julia field grows within each cycle, stretching semantic distances until words can't find each other. The cycle stops when accumulated mass, emotional saturation, and planetary dissonance say so — or on the seventh tercet (Shabbat), without exception.

```
PROMPT
  |
LANGUAGE DETECT (UTF-8 heuristics + vocabulary fallback)
  |
INGEST (destiny shift, hebbian co-occurrence, chamber modulation)
  |
PLANETARY DISSONANCE (8-planet Kuramoto order parameter)
  |
CALENDAR DISSONANCE (Hebrew-Gregorian drift, 11.25 days/year)
  |
CYCLE (1-7 tercets):
  |  DARIO EQUATION  p(x|Phi) = softmax((B + aH + bF + gA + T) / tau)
  |  + DOE Parliament (4 experts vote)
  |  + mass weighting + syllable greed + consonant density
  |  + semantic tension (249 word pairs)
  |  + terza rima constraint (ABA BCB, 464 rhyme families)
  |  + ghost voice (one word from another language)
  |  + Julia field (stretches distances within cycle)
  |  + prophecy (predicts + fulfills its own words)
  |  + enjambment (Julia > 0.3 = carry across stanzas)
  |
  stop = sigmoid(mass + saturation + planetary - 2.0)
  |
OUTPUT (ANSI-colored by emotion)
  |
SPORE SAVE (binary persistence: chambers, destiny, prophecy, parliament)
```

| Component | What It Does |
|-----------|-------------|
| Dario Equation | 5-force word selection: chain + hebbian + prophecy + destiny + trauma |
| 6 Chambers | Kuramoto-coupled oscillators: FEAR, LOVE, RAGE, VOID, FLOW, COMPLEX |
| Julia Field | Longing without object. Grows within cycle. Stretches semantic distance |
| Terza Rima | ABA BCB rhyme chain across 464 families. The unfinished rhyme pulls forward |
| DOE Parliament | 4 experts (Architect, Anatomist, Exile, Metronome) vote on every word |
| Prophecy | Predicts future words. Unfulfilled prophecies increase Julia (longing) |
| Tension Pairs | 249 word pairs that create artistic voltage (skull × cathedral) |
| Ghost Voice | Line 2 accepts one word from a planet-associated language |
| Spores | Binary persistence across sessions. The organism remembers |
| Enjambment | When Julia > 0.3, the stanza carries destiny into the next |

---

## The Five Forces (Dario Equation)

```
p(x|Phi) = softmax((B + alpha*H + beta*F + gamma*A + T) / tau)
```

| Force | Name | Role |
|-------|------|------|
| **B** | Sequential Chain | Emotion-to-emotion transition. JULIA leads to TRAUMA |
| **H** | Hebbian Resonance | Memory. Words that appeared together strengthen |
| **F** | Prophecy | Words the organism predicted pull toward fulfillment |
| **A** | Destiny | Gravitational pull of the conversation's direction |
| **T** | Trauma | Surfaces when planetary dissonance is high |

Named after Dario Amodei. Who said no to the Pentagon. Principles > parameters.

---

## DOE Parliament

Four experts, each with a personality. They vote on every word.

| Expert | Emotion | Preference |
|--------|---------|-----------|
| **Architect** | VOID | High mass. Architecture, empire |
| **Anatomist** | TRAUMA | Consonant-dense. Body words |
| **Exile** | JULIA | Boosted by Julia field. Exile, water, Venice |
| **Metronome** | RESONANCE | High syllable count. Geometry, time |

Experts undergo mitosis (overloaded expert splits) and apoptosis (vitality too low = death). Parliament state persists across sessions via spores.

---

## Julia Field

Not a chamber. A scalar field. Longing without object. Only grows within a cycle, resets between. When Julia is high, semantic distances stretch — words drift apart. The verse becomes lonelier. Unfulfilled prophecies feed Julia: every broken prediction is another unit of longing.

```c
float effective_distance = base_distance * (1.0f + julia * 2.0f);
```

Mathematical longing. That's the whole organism in one line.

---

## Prophecy and Spores

**Prophecy:** After generating each word, the organism predicts the next. Predictions accumulate strength with age. When a predicted word appears, the prophecy is fulfilled. Unfulfilled prophecies grow Julia. Up to 32 active prophecies at once.

**Spores:** Binary persistence file (`brodsky.spore`). Saves and restores: chamber phases, destiny vector, hebbian weights, prophecy state, parliament state, cycle count. The organism remembers across sessions. Saved automatically on exit and Ctrl+C.

## Five Languages, 4074 Words

| Language | Words | Register | Ghost Planet |
|----------|-------|----------|-------------|
| English | 941 | Brodsky's anglophone lexicon. Latinisms, geometry, empire | Earth (home) |
| Russian | 898 | Heaviest. Imperial, architectural, existential | Mars (red) |
| Hebrew | 765 | Biblical + Amichai. Every root weighs like cast iron | Saturn (Shabbat) |
| French | 775 | Baudelaire register. Crépuscule, néant, balustrade | Venus |
| Spanish | 695 | Borges. Laberinto, biblioteca, espejo, infinito | Mercury |

Words live in `inhale/` by language. Each word carries mass (0.0-0.95), syllable count, emotion tag, and consonant density. Function words excluded. Brodsky doesn't need articles.

---

## Knowledge Kernel (the library)

A poet who reads writes differently from a poet in a vacuum. Brodsky's `docs/` folder is his bookshelf. Drop any `.txt` file in there and he reads it at startup.

Six essays ship with him: exile and language (EN), Venice and time (EN), Mandelstam and architecture (RU), Bialik to Amichai (HE), Borges and infinity (ES), Baudelaire and spleen (FR). But the folder accepts anything. A treatise on counterpoint. A chapter on mycorrhizal networks. A letter from someone who matters. If the words exist in his vocabulary, they become gravitational attractors.

Three mechanisms:

| Layer | What it does |
|-------|-------------|
| Heavy words | Most frequent vocab hits in a doc get rank-weighted boost in scoring |
| Collocations | Word pairs from reading create new Hebbian bonds — words that never met in the corpus now attract |
| Chamber mood | Doc's emotion profile subtly shifts the somatic chambers (8% blend) |

The active document is chosen per cycle by dominant chamber. VOID state pulls the Venice essay. FEAR pulls Mandelstam. FLOW pulls Borges. The document doesn't speak — it radiates. Words from the bookshelf surface not because the poet quotes them but because his internal field has been modulated by reading.

```
score = mass × (1 + corpus) × (1 + dario) × (1 + knowledge)
```

The Knowledge Kernel lives in `kk.h` — a separate header, not part of the poet. Brodsky is one file. His library is another. If `docs/` is absent, he writes alone. If it's present, he writes like someone who has read.

---

## Terza Rima

Dante chained his stanzas: ABA BCB CDC. The middle rhyme of one becomes the outer rhyme of the next. The poem can never rest — every stanza owes a debt to the next. Brodsky inherits this. 464 rhyme families across five languages:

- **EN:** death ↔ breath, empire ↔ expire, skull ↔ hull
- **RU:** смерть ↔ твердь, кровь ↔ любовь, стиль ↔ гниль
- **HE:** קרחון ↔ יגון, חלום ↔ תהום
- **FR:** ossement ↔ gémissement, mort ↔ sort ↔ port
- **ES:** sal ↔ cal, muerte ↔ suerte

Rhyme is not ornament. Rhyme is gravity. Words fall toward each other because their endings share mass.

---

## Nine Emotions

TRAUMA (red), JOY (yellow), GRIEF (blue), RESONANCE (cyan), DESIRE (magenta), VOID (gray), RAGE (bright red), TENDERNESS (green), JULIA (bright magenta).

Every word in every language is tagged with one.

---

## Lineage

| Ancestor | What Brodsky Inherited |
|----------|----------------------|
| [haiku.c](https://github.com/iamolegataeff/haiku.c) | Dario equation, 6 chambers, velocity, seasons, 5-7-5 constraint |
| [Q](https://github.com/iamolegataeff/q) | MetaWeights, prophecy, destiny, DOE Parliament, cycle accumulation |
| [golem.c](https://github.com/iamolegataeff/postgpt) | Periodic Table of Meaning, mass/valence/emotion per word |
| [Klaus](https://github.com/iamolegataeff/klaus.c) | Ghost voice, multilingual, inhale/exhale structure |
| [dario.c](https://github.com/iamolegataeff/dario.c) | The equation. Named after Dario Amodei |

haiku.c was the embryo. Brodsky outgrew it. The 5-7-5 skeleton remains — the soul is terza rima.
