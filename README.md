# BRODSKY

*In memory of Joseph Brodsky (1940-1996)*

**Code can be a poet.** Not a generator, not a template engine, not a Markov chain with pretensions. A poet: an organism that takes your word and returns something heavier than what you gave it. Brodsky doesn't write about what you said. He writes about what your words did to him. You say "exile" -- he answers with vertebrae and empires. You say "love" -- he answers with gangrene and cartography. You say nothing -- he speaks anyway, because silence is a prompt too. One C file. Five languages. Zero weights. 2903 lines of constraint that birth form. The haiku is 5-7-5. The heaviness is in the words. The poet is in the architecture.

A real poet doesn't write on command. He is mechanical. Deliberately heavy. Like Rammstein, but in haiku. He prefers "perpendicular" over "straight", "deterioration" over "decay", "antimatter" over "nothing". Through every language, another bleeds -- `citerne` in Russian, `radiateur` in English, `enfer` in Spanish. The constraint is 5-7-5. The ghost is in line two.

---

## Quick Start

```bash
make
./brodsky
```

Or:

```bash
cc brodsky.c -O2 -lm -o brodsky
./brodsky
```

Speak to him in any of five languages:

```
brodsky> exile and empire          # English
brodsky> империя и изгнание        # Russian
brodsky> גלות ומוות                # Hebrew
brodsky> neant et crepuscule       # French
brodsky> laberinto y espejo        # Spanish
```

He answers in haiku. In your language. With ghost words from another.

## Architecture

Brodsky is a reactive poet. Input does not produce output -- input shifts the internal state, and the organism generates from that shifted state. Every word you give him modulates six Kuramoto-coupled chambers, drifts an 8-dimensional destiny vector, adjusts planetary dissonance from real orbital mechanics, and feeds a prophecy system that predicts its own future words. A DOE Parliament of four experts votes on every word. The Julia field grows within each cycle, stretching semantic distances until words can't find each other. The haiku stops when accumulated mass, emotional saturation, and planetary dissonance say so -- or on the seventh haiku (Shabbat), without exception.

```
PROMPT
  |
LANGUAGE DETECT (UTF-8 heuristics + vocabulary fallback)
  |
INGEST (destiny shift, hebbian co-occurrence, chamber modulation)
  |
PLANETARY DISSONANCE (8-planet Kuramoto order parameter)
  |
CALENDAR DISSONANCE (Hebrew-Gregorian drift, 11.25 days/year)
  |
CYCLE (1-7 haiku):
  |  DARIO EQUATION  p(x|Phi) = softmax((B + aH + bF + gA + T) / tau)
  |  + DOE Parliament (4 experts vote)
  |  + mass weighting + syllable greed + consonant density
  |  + semantic tension (250+ word pairs)
  |  + ghost voice (one word from another language)
  |  + Julia field (stretches distances within cycle)
  |  + prophecy (predicts + fulfills its own words)
  |  + enjambment (Julia > 0.3 = carry across haiku)
  |
  stop = sigmoid(mass + saturation + planetary - 2.0)
  |
OUTPUT (ANSI-colored by emotion)
  |
SPORE SAVE (binary persistence: chambers, destiny, prophecy, parliament)
```

| Component | What It Does |
|-----------|-------------|
| Dario Equation | 5-force word selection: chain + hebbian + prophecy + destiny + trauma |
| 6 Chambers | Kuramoto-coupled oscillators: FEAR, LOVE, RAGE, VOID, FLOW, COMPLEX |
| Julia Field | Longing without object. Grows within cycle. Stretches semantic distance |
| DOE Parliament | 4 experts (Architect, Anatomist, Exile, Metronome) vote on every word |
| Prophecy | Predicts future words. Unfulfilled prophecies increase Julia (longing) |
| Tension Pairs | 250+ word pairs that create artistic voltage (skull x cathedral) |
| Ghost Voice | Line 2 accepts one word from a planet-associated language |
| Spores | Binary persistence across sessions. Chambers, destiny, prophecy, parliament survive |
| Enjambment | When Julia > 0.3, the haiku carries destiny into the next |

---

## The Five Forces (Dario Equation)

```
p(x|Phi) = softmax((B + alpha*H + beta*F + gamma*A + T) / tau)
```

| Force | Name | Role |
|-------|------|------|
| **B** | Sequential Chain | Emotion-to-emotion transition. JULIA leads to TRAUMA |
| **H** | Hebbian Resonance | Memory. Words that appeared together strengthen |
| **F** | Prophecy | Words the organism predicted pull toward fulfillment |
| **A** | Destiny | Gravitational pull of the conversation's direction |
| **T** | Trauma | Surfaces when planetary dissonance is high |

Named after Dario Amodei.

## DOE Parliament

Four experts, each with a personality. They vote on every word.

| Expert | Emotion | Preference |
|--------|---------|-----------|
| **Architect** | VOID | High mass. Architecture, empire |
| **Anatomist** | TRAUMA | Consonant-dense. Body words |
| **Exile** | JULIA | Boosted by Julia field. Exile, water, Venice |
| **Metronome** | RESONANCE | High syllable count. Geometry, time |

Experts undergo mitosis (overloaded expert splits) and apoptosis (vitality too low = death). Parliament state persists across sessions via spores.

---

## Julia Field

Not a chamber. A scalar field. Longing without object. Only grows within a cycle, resets between. When Julia is high, semantic distances stretch -- words drift apart. The haiku becomes lonelier. Unfulfilled prophecies feed Julia: every broken prediction is another unit of longing.

```c
float effective_distance = base_distance * (1.0f + julia * 2.0f);
```

---

## Prophecy and Spores

**Prophecy:** After generating each word, the organism predicts the next. Predictions accumulate strength with age. When a predicted word appears, the prophecy is fulfilled. Unfulfilled prophecies grow Julia. Up to 32 active prophecies at once.

**Spores:** Binary persistence file (`brodsky.spore`). Saves and restores: chamber phases, destiny vector, hebbian weights, prophecy state, parliament state, cycle count. The organism remembers across sessions. Saved automatically on exit and Ctrl+C.

## Five Languages, 2155 Words

| Language | Words | Register | Ghost Planet |
|----------|-------|----------|-------------|
| English | 501 | Brodsky's anglophone lexicon. Latinisms, geometry, empire | Earth (home) |
| Russian | 501 | Heaviest. Imperial, architectural, existential | Mars (red) |
| Hebrew | 401 | Biblical + Amichai. Every root weighs like cast iron | Saturn (Shabbat) |
| French | 400 | Baudelaire register. Crepuscule, neant, balustrade | Venus |
| Spanish | 401 | Borges. Laberinto, biblioteca, espejo, infinito | Mercury |

Words are organized in `inhale/` by language. Each word carries mass (0.0-0.95), syllable count, emotion tag, and consonant density. Function words excluded. Brodsky doesn't need articles.

---

## Nine Emotions

TRAUMA (red), JOY (yellow), GRIEF (blue), RESONANCE (cyan), DESIRE (magenta), VOID (gray), RAGE (bright red), TENDERNESS (green), JULIA (bright magenta).

Every word in every language is tagged with one.
